                    Due to having only a satisfied level of HTML knowledge it required me to do research and learn the
                    types of ways I could begin coding the pop-up feature. This could enable me to look at a variety of
                    different websites with pop-up pages and inspect how they had gone about coding their version of a
                    pop-up, hence why I have the learning and researching part taking the longest in this process.
                    Furthermore, I would have to look at a variety of designs that had been used as well as ensuring the
                    colour of the pop-up box is suitable to the colour scheme of the website which should take a little
                    longer than actually coding and testing it as a result of it not being too complex. This now leads
                    to me assuming that coding and testing taking similar times as I would need to ensure I have code it
                    correct and review it during the testing stage to ensure it is doing what the group wants it to as
                    well as the positioning of where it should pop-up and ensure it has displayed text on the box.
